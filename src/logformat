If specified as a client option, transfer logging will be enabled with a default 
format of “%i %n%L”. See the --log-file-format option if you wish to override this.

%i
%n
%L

The single-character escapes that are understood are as follows:

o      %a the remote IP address

o      %b the number of bytes actually transferred

o      %B the permission bits of the file (e.g. rwxrwxrwt)

o      %c the checksum bytes received for this file (only when sending)

o      %f the filename (long form on sender; no trailing “/”)

o      %G the gid of the file (decimal) or “DEFAULT”

o      %h the remote host name

o      %i an itemized list of what is being updated

o      %l the length of the file in bytes

o      %L the string “ -> SYMLINK”,  “  =>  HARDLINK”,  or  “”  (where  SYMLINK  or
	 HARDLINK is a filename)

o      %m the module name

o      %M the last-modified time of the file

o      %n the filename (short form; trailing “/” on dir)

o      %o  the  operation,  which is “send”, “recv”, or “del.” (the latter includes
	 the trailing period)

o      %p the process ID of this rsync session

o      %P the module path

o      %t the current date time

o      %u the authenticated username or an empty string

o      %U the uid of the file (decimal)

For a list of what the characters mean that are output by  “%i”,  see  the  --item‐
ize-changes option in the rsync manpage.
