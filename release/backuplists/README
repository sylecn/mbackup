Backup lists and Exclude lists
------------------------------

There are two kinds of lists, one is for files to backup, one is for files to
exclude from backup.

lists named user.* are backup lists.
lists named excl.* are exclude lists.

A backup list is used in rsync --files-from option.
An exclude list is used in rsync --exclude-from option.

For detailed syntax see man rsync, esp. INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERN RULES section.

Here is a brief note on the format of backup list:

#filenames are all relative to the source dir (in my case "/")
#  any leading slashes are removed and no “..” references are allowed to go
#  higher than the source dir.

#try not to add a single file here. (confs are just fine)
#  please add dir and use the exclude file to filter what you don't want.
#  this will allow rsync delete the backup file once you remove it from the list

#files and dirs should *not* end with '/'
#files and dirs should always use absolute path start with "/", without ".." "."

Here is a brief note on the format of exclude list:

#things you don't want to include in backup should come here
#  big files in dir
#  large amount of small files in dir
#  cache files or other tmp files

#use *** to match all files and subdirs in the dir
#use * to match any char except /
