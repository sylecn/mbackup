# this is the major backup list for user data
# see README file in this dir for more infomation

#notice:
#files and dirs should *not* end with '/'
#files and dirs should always use absolute path start with "/", without ".." "."

#a few things might be good to be here:
#  important system files which are not portable
#      /boot
#      /etc/fstab
#      /etc/apt
#  server roots
#      /var/www
#      /var/ftp
#  user created data
#      ~/projects
#      ~/homeworks
