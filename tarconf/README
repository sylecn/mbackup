tarconf

tarconf helps you backup all your public configs into a tar.gz file, which you
can upload to your web server or transfer to your remote ssh server.

[install]
get ready filelist:
#files to backup
~/.mbackup/backuplists/user.publicconfigs
#files to exclude
~/.mbackup/backuplists/tarconf.excl

helper scripts:
#remove comments and nonexists file
~/bin/remove-nonexists-files
#remove leading slash
~/bin/remove-leading-slash

install to crontab
I use ~/bin/admin-summary.weekly
