[Description]
mbakcup is backup tool supposed to run via crontab everyday.
mb is a script to update the backup and cp current backup to external device.

Both of them use rsync to transfer your files and support a highly
customizable backup file list.

[Install]
1. get the following files ready:
/usr/local/bin/mbackup       # main script for cron
~/bin/mb                     # manual backup
~/bin/ubl                    # manual updated backup list
~/.mbackup/backuplists/*     # backup lists
~/.mbackup/config            # mbackup config file

see also [backup list format].

2. setup cron job using /etc/crontab
00 20   *     *   *   root    /usr/local/bin/mbackup
45 19   *     *   *   sylecn  /home/sylecn/bin/ubl >/dev/null

If you prefer using crontab for each user, use crontab -e for root and user.

[Config]
TODO mb and mbackup should report error if mbakcup is not configed correctly.
     for example, missing filelist
~/.mbackup/config
-----------------
#default target dir for local backups
targetdir="/backup"

~/.mbackup/backuplists/*
------------------------
#there is an init version containing commented examples

put all files you need to backup there.
predefined lists you may use are:
user.public
user.publicconfigs
user.private
excl.default

read the README file in that dir for more infomation.

TODO ubl will read all user.* as backup list
     ubl will read all excl.* as exclude list
