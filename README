[Description]
mbakcup is backup tool supposed to run via crontab everyday.
mb is a script to update the backup and cp current backup to external device.

Both of them use rsync to transfer your files and support a highly
customizable backup file list.

[Install]
1. get the following files ready:
/usr/local/bin/mbackup       # main script for cron
~/bin/mb                     # manual backup
~/bin/ubl                    # manual updated backup list
~/.mbackup/backuplists/*     # backup lists
~/.mbackup/config            # mbackup config file

see also [backup list format].

2. setup cron job using /etc/crontab
00 20   *     *   *   root    /usr/local/bin/mbackup
45 19   *     *   *   sylecn  /home/sylecn/bin/ubl >/dev/null

If you prefer using crontab for each user, use crontab -e for root and user.

[Config]
TODO mb and mbackup should report error if mbakcup is not configed correctly.
     for example, missing filelist
~/.mbackup/config
-----------------
#default target dir for local backups
targetdir="/backup"

~/.mbackup/backuplists/*
------------------------
#there is an init version containing commented examples

put all files you need to backup there.
predefined lists you may use are:
user.public
user.publicconfigs
user.private
excl.default

TODO ubl will read all user.* as backup list
     ubl will read all excl.* as exclude list

[test your install]

keep the backup list modest when you are testing the setup.

1. manual backup
   run mb from console.

2. cron backup
   change the run time to let the cron job run.
   check the log in /var/log/mbackup.log to make sure every is OK.
   then change the run time back.

[finishing step]
add your backup lists file to your backup list.
add all files you want to backup in your backup lists.

[backup list format]
A backup list is used for rsync in
--files-from
--exclude-from
options.
For detailed syntax see man rsync, esp. INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERN RULES section.

the format for backup list:
---------------------------
#filenames are all relative to the source dir (in my case "/")
#  any leading slashes are removed and no “..” references are allowed to go
#  higher than the source dir.

#try not to add a single file here. (confs are just fine)
#  please add dir and use the exclude file to filter what you don't want.
#  this will allow rsync delete the backup file once you remove it from the list

#files and dirs should *not* end with '/'
#files and dirs should always use absolute path start with "/", without ".." "."

the format for exclude file list:
---------------------------------
#things you don't want to include in backup should come here
#  big files in dir
#  large amount of small files in dir
#  cache files or other tmp files

#use *** to match all files and subdirs in the dir
#use * to match any char except /
